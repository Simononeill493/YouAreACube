# Unfinished Cube Game

Old prototype version of a strategy game I'm working on. <br>
Tab opens the menu, and WASD moves the player, but there's not much going on here. I changed a lot of my ideas while developing the game, so the current version is quite different. <br>
You'll have to change the root data path in Config.cs to point to your own data directory (Simon_data) <br>
